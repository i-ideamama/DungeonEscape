## You are trapped in a dark dungeon filled with traps and enemies...
...your only hope is to scan the dungeon with your lidar scanners and reach the end goal safely.
BUT, beware... the LIDAR scanner's detection only lasts for a little while so you have to be quick!

Controls:
- Use WASD keys to navigate
- Use Spacebar to jump over obstacles
- Press E to switch between blasters
- Press Q or Left Mouse Button to shoot LIDAR points
- Press C to spawn the checkpoint
